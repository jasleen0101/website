            <p><h2> Product Description</h2>
                Some people suffer from breathing difficulties during sleep. This condition is called sleep apnea. 
                If left unattended, this can cause trouble in the form of heart issues, high blood pressure, etc. 
                Doctors prescribe the BiPAP machine to treat this condition and improve the quality of sleep. 
                This is the device that will help you breathe freely by clearing the obstructions. BiPAP gets 
                its name from Bilevel positive airway pressure machine.
                BiPAP machines can be used at home or in the hospital. You wear a mask around
                 your face and mouth, and the BiPAP machine delivers pressurized air through 
                 these masks so that you can breathe properly. A tube flows from the machine to the 
                 mask to take the purified air.
                 This machine is different from the CPAP machine since it is a bilevel machine. 
                 This means it has two air pressure settings:<br>
                 One of the settings is the IPAP or inspiratory positive air pressure. 
                 Here more pressure is delivered when you breathe in.
                 The other is called the expiratory positive air pressure or the EPAP. 
                 The machine reduces the pressure when you exhale.
                 The pressure during inhalation and exhalation can also be set with the help of a timer. </p> <br>
