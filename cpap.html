            <p><h2> Product Description</h2>
                A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine is a medical device that delivers a
                 constant, gentle flow of pressurized air into your nose or mouth to keep your airway open
                  while you sleep.1 Healthcare providers prescribe CPAP therapy to treat sleep-related
                   breathing disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, in which tissues in your mouth and
                    throat narrow or close your airways, causing your breath to stop momentarily.<br>
                    2 Using a CPAP machine can be a significant lifestyle change. You will need to 
                    use it every night, including when you travel, and likely during naps as well.
                     However, it's an effective treatment option that can improve your sleep and your 
                     overall quality of life. There are several different CPAP options, and they're all
                      relatively simple to use. </p> <br>
